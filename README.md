Freehand-Tools
==============
This is a scripted loadable module for 3D Slicer. It is intended to be able to display non-orthogonal slices of a 3D model
acquired with a 3D freehand ultrasound system.

To use, you can either:
1. Add the module from the command line when starting Slicer:
>> slicer --additional-module-paths <.../Freehand-Tools/SliceScroller/> 

2. Add the module in 3D Slicer by going to Edit, Application Settings, Modules, then clicking the small ">>" next to
the "Additional module paths" box, pressing "Add" in the new box that shows up, then selecting the "SliceScroller" folder.


Afterwards, start Slicer and select the Freehand Slice Scroller module, which should be located under the Freehand Category.
